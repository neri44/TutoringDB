# TutoringDB
A database for a tutor with multiple students across different subjects, levels, noting rates, scheduling (incl. reschedules cancellations and payments)

I work as a private tutor and wanted to learn SQL by working on a project I am familiar with. 

Comments, feedback and questions welcome!
